    "2. **ZipCode risk differences**: If rejected, consider fine-grained geographic rating factors. High-risk zip codes can be flagged for underwriting review.\n\n",
    "3. **ZipCode margin differences**: If rejected, some zip codes are more profitable. Marketing can target high-margin areas; pricing can be adjusted in low-margin areas.\n\n",
    "4. **Gender risk differences**: If rejected, gender is statistically associated with claim frequency. However, practical significance and regulatory constraints must be considered before using gender in pricing.\n\n",
